With a degree in Physics, she began her career as an astronaut in 1993 on the space shuttle, which lasted 9 days. She has traveled to space three more times and her last trip was in 2002, and she has accumulated more than 1,000 flight hours. Although Ellen Ochoa did not dream of being an astronaut in her childhood, she did receive great inspiration from witnessing the space trip of the American In June 1983. From that moment, Ellen realized that she could follow the same path as Sally and fly to space. Ellen Ochoa is known not only for being the first female astronaut of Hispanic origin to fly in space, if not also because it has been Among his inventions are optical recognition systems, computer devices and mechanical guidance systems.
